Definition of Bash scripting.
A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line. 
It allows you to perform a series of actions, such as navigating to a specific directory, creating a folder, and launching a process using the command line.
By saving these commands in a script, you can repeat the same sequence of steps multiple times and execute them by running the script.
